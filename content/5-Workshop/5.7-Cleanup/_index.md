After completing the workshop for deploying **EAM Workspace** on AWS, unused resources should be cleaned up to avoid unexpected AWS charges. In this workshop, the main resources include **AWS Amplify Hosting**, **Amazon API Gateway**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **Amazon RDS for MySQL**, **Amazon SES**, security groups, and related logs/metrics.

Before deleting resources, capture the important screens for the report. These screenshots show that the project was deployed, tested, and has a clear cleanup plan.

### Workshop Summary

In this workshop, EAM Workspace was deployed as a full-stack web application on AWS:

- The React/Vite frontend was built and hosted with **AWS Amplify Hosting**.
- Frontend `/api/*` requests were routed to **Amazon API Gateway**.
- API Gateway forwarded requests to the backend running on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
- The backend connected to **Amazon RDS for MySQL** for business data.
- Email/OTP functionality used **Amazon SES** through SMTP credentials.
- Deployment results were validated with the health endpoint, login page, dashboard, and key business screens.

After testing and capturing screenshots, the demo resources can be cleaned up in the order below.

## Step 1: Record Resources To Clean Up

Before deleting anything, record the names of resources created during the workshop:

| Resource Group | Name or Item To Check |
| --- | --- |
| Amplify app | Frontend app `quanlidoanhnghiep` or deployment branch `aws-architecture` |
| API Gateway | HTTP API `eam-backend-http-api` |
| Elastic Beanstalk | Backend environment, for example `eam-backend-prod-v8` |
| RDS | MySQL database used by EAM Workspace |
| SES | Email identity and SMTP credential used for email |
| CloudWatch | Logs/metrics related to Elastic Beanstalk or API |
| EC2/Security Group | Security groups for Elastic Beanstalk and RDS |

This list helps avoid deleting resources that do not belong to the workshop.

## Step 2: Delete or Disconnect the AWS Amplify App

AWS Amplify Hosting is used to build and publish the frontend. If the demo frontend is no longer needed, the app can be deleted or the deployment branch can be disconnected.

Steps:

1. Open the **AWS Amplify** console.
2. Select the frontend app, for example `quanlidoanhnghiep`.
3. Select the deployment branch, for example `aws-architecture`.
4. Capture the app/branch screen before deletion.
5. If a full cleanup is required, go to **App settings** or **General settings** and delete the app.
6. Confirm that the Amplify domain is no longer used for the demo.

If the frontend is still needed for presentation, Amplify can be kept temporarily, but this should be noted in the report.

*Figure 5.7.1. AWS Amplify app `quanlidoanhnghiep` and branch `aws-architecture` before cleanup. This screenshot records that the frontend was deployed successfully, had an active Amplify domain, and should be handled if the demo is no longer maintained.*

After capturing this screenshot, clean up Amplify as follows:

1. If the demo frontend is no longer needed, go to **App settings** -> **General settings** -> **Delete app**.
2. If only the deployment branch should be removed, select the `aws-architecture` branch and disconnect/delete it.
3. Check the Amplify domain again after deletion to confirm the public URL is no longer available.
4. If the app is kept for report presentation, note that Amplify is still active and continue monitoring its cost in Billing.

## Step 3: Delete Amazon API Gateway

API Gateway is the public endpoint layer used by the frontend to call the backend. If the API is no longer used, delete it so the endpoint no longer receives requests.

Steps:

1. Open the **Amazon API Gateway** console.
2. Select the project HTTP API, for example `eam-backend-http-api`.
3. Check the `ANY /{proxy+}` route and the integration pointing to the Elastic Beanstalk backend.
4. Capture the API list or route/integration page.
5. Choose **Delete** if the API is no longer needed.
6. Check the API list again to confirm deletion.

After API Gateway is deleted, URLs in the form `https://...execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/...` will no longer work.

![API Gateway cleanup](/images/5-Workshop/5.7-Cleanup/5.7.2-api-gateway-cleanup.png)

*Figure 5.7.2. HTTP API `eam-backend-http-api` in Amazon API Gateway before deletion. This screen confirms the correct public backend API endpoint and helps avoid deleting an API that does not belong to the project.*

After capturing the API screenshot, clean it up as follows:

1. Select the correct HTTP API `eam-backend-http-api`.
2. Recheck the `ANY /{proxy+}` route and its integration with the Elastic Beanstalk backend.
3. If the frontend/backend demo is no longer used, choose **Delete** to remove the API.
4. After deletion, test the API endpoint again or check the API list to confirm it no longer exists.
5. If Amplify is still kept, update the rewrite configuration or note that `/api/*` requests will no longer work.

## Step 4: Terminate the Elastic Beanstalk Environment

Elastic Beanstalk manages the Node.js/Express backend environment. It may create EC2 instances, load balancers, Auto Scaling resources, and security groups, so it should be terminated when no longer used.

Steps:

1. Open the **Elastic Beanstalk** console.
2. Select the backend environment, for example `eam-backend-prod-v8`.
3. Capture the environment screen before termination, including health, platform, and domain.
4. Choose **Actions** -> **Terminate environment**.
5. Enter the environment name if AWS asks for confirmation.
6. Wait until the environment is fully terminated.
7. Check the EC2 console to make sure instances created by Elastic Beanstalk are stopped/deleted.

If Elastic Beanstalk cannot terminate because of dependencies, check related security groups, load balancers, or EC2 resources.

![Elastic Beanstalk cleanup](/images/5-Workshop/5.7-Cleanup/5.7.3-eb-cleanup.png)

*Figure 5.7.3. Elastic Beanstalk environment `eam-backend-prod-v8` before termination. The screenshot shows that the backend environment was healthy, had its own domain, and could continue generating cost if left running.*

To clean up the Elastic Beanstalk backend:

1. Open the `eam-backend-prod-v8` environment.
2. Choose **Actions** -> **Terminate environment**.
3. Enter the exact environment name if AWS asks for confirmation.
4. Wait until the environment is terminated, then check EC2 to confirm the related instances/load balancers were removed.
5. If termination fails because of dependencies, check related load balancers, Auto Scaling groups, network interfaces, and security groups.

## Step 5: Delete or Stop Amazon RDS for MySQL

Amazon RDS is an important resource because database instances can continue to generate cost while running. Before deleting it, decide whether the demo data still needs to be kept.

Steps:

1. Open the **Amazon RDS** console.
2. Select the MySQL database used by EAM Workspace.
3. Capture the database list or database detail screen.
4. Create a snapshot first if the data must be kept.
5. If the data is no longer needed, choose **Delete**.
6. For a demo environment, a final snapshot can be skipped if the data is not required.
7. Confirm that the database changes to deleting/deleted status.

If the RDS database is not deleted immediately, stop it if appropriate and continue monitoring cost in Billing.

![RDS cleanup](/images/5-Workshop/5.7-Cleanup/5.7.4-rds-cleanup.png)

*Figure 5.7.4. Amazon RDS database `eam-mysql` before cleanup. This resource needs careful attention because a database instance can still incur cost while it remains available.*

For RDS, cleanup should be done carefully because data may be lost:

1. If demo data must be kept, create a snapshot before deleting the database.
2. If the data is no longer required, select `eam-mysql` -> **Actions** -> **Delete**.
3. For a demo environment, the final snapshot can be skipped only when recovery is not needed.
4. Confirm that the database changes to deleting/deleted status.
5. After RDS is deleted, check related security groups because they may no longer have dependencies and can be removed.

## Step 6: Check Amazon SES

Amazon SES is used to verify an email identity and create SMTP credentials for email/OTP. SES usually does not generate large costs if email volume is low, but the configuration should still be reviewed.

Steps:

1. Open the **Amazon SES** console.
2. Check the verified email identity.
3. Check the SMTP credential/IAM user created for SES.
4. If it is no longer used, delete the IAM user or credential related to SMTP.
5. Do not include SMTP passwords in screenshots or the report.

If SES is kept for further demo, store credentials carefully and do not commit them to GitHub.

![SES cleanup](/images/5-Workshop/5.7-Cleanup/5.7.5-ses-cleanup.png)

*Figure 5.7.5. Verified Amazon SES email identity in the Singapore region. This screenshot records the email/OTP sending configuration for the backend while keeping SMTP credentials out of the report.*

For SES, cleanup focuses on the identity and credentials:

1. If email/OTP sending is no longer needed, delete the email identity in Amazon SES.
2. Open IAM and find the SMTP user/credential created for SES.
3. Delete the access key or IAM user if it is no longer used.
4. Recheck Elastic Beanstalk environment variables and local `.env` files so `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, or SMTP secrets are not committed to GitHub.
5. Do not capture or include SMTP passwords in the report.

## Step 7: Delete Security Groups and Dependent Resources

After Elastic Beanstalk and RDS are deleted, check security groups that are no longer used.

Steps:

1. Open the **EC2** console.
2. Go to **Security Groups**.
3. Find security groups related to the Elastic Beanstalk backend and RDS.
4. Delete a security group only when no resources depend on it.
5. If AWS reports a dependency error, check EC2 instances, load balancers, RDS, or network interfaces.

Do not delete default security groups or security groups that are not part of the workshop.

## Step 8: Check CloudWatch and Billing

After the main resources are cleaned up, check logs and costs.

Steps:

1. Open the **CloudWatch** console.
2. Check log groups related to Elastic Beanstalk or the backend.
3. Delete unused log groups or reduce retention if logs should be kept.
4. Open **Billing and Cost Management**.
5. Check Cost Explorer or Bills to confirm there are no unexpected costs.

The resources that should be checked most carefully for cost are RDS databases, EC2/Elastic Beanstalk, load balancers, NAT Gateways, Elastic IPs, and CloudWatch Logs.

*Figure 5.7.6. Billing and Cost Management used to review costs after the AWS deployment. The Cost summary and Cost breakdown help check charges by service, such as RDS, EC2, VPC, and Amplify.*

After cleaning up the main resources, verify cost status:

1. Open **Billing and Cost Management**.
2. Check **Cost summary** for the current month cost and end-of-month forecast.
3. Review **Cost breakdown** by service to identify any service that is still generating charges.
4. Pay special attention to Amazon RDS, EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, VPC, API Gateway, Amplify, and CloudWatch.
5. If the cost still increases unexpectedly after cleanup, return to each service and check for remaining resources.
